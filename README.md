# QR Code Generator API Project

## Description

This project involves building a user interface from scratch with HTML and CSS, adding some functionality with JavaScript, and calling an API to give the user a result they can use.

In this project, I worked with input fields, fieldset, and buttons with attributes - adding/removing/changing them depending on the userâ€™s input. I created a user interface based on the options the API gives me, ensuring the user provides the required information and giving the user feedback if not.
